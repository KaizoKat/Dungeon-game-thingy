# Dungeon-game-thingy
This is the game that I made in two weeks in HaxeFlixel

Please go trough the tutorial linked in my blog as you will not be really able to play it without that.
Or, if you dont really want to go trough the hastle, just go in the file, EXPORT >> NEKO >> BIN >> TurnBasedRPG.exe
After that, a comand line will pop up and neko will run the game.
There is no content, just a basic tutorial game.
